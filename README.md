**BASIC MATH QUESTION SOLVER**
**Computer Vision Project with Deep Learning**

A basic math question solver project that implements deep learning techniques for image analysis and recognition. This project was inspired by various public projects available on GitHub and combines essential concepts of deep learning and computer vision.

**What does this project do ?**

This project employs the principles of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing (OpenCV) to train handwritten images of mathematical notations. OpenCV is utilized to read these images, which are subsequently employed to read images from user input and solve basic mathematical questions utilizing the Python library of SymPy.

**Features**

**Data Preprocessing:** Basic image loading, normalization, and augmentation techniques.
**Model Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks.
**Training and Evaluation**: Model training using deep learning frameworks and performance evaluation with common metrics.
